== Azure Functions

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/[Documentation]

=== General
An advancement from app service towards more serverless approach. -> we care less about IO, and more about just the code executing the task.
Azure Functions supports triggers, which are ways to start execution of your code, and bindings, which are ways to simplify coding for input and output data.
Functions is built on an app service. Function instance in the default - consumption plan, is a single CPU and 1.5GB memory. (due to single cpu, garbage collector pauses are likely).

=== Hosting plans
There are three basic hosting plans available for Azure Functions. All available on both linux and windows machines:
* Consumption plan - This is the default hosting plan. It scales automatically and you only pay for compute resources when your functions are running. Instances of the Functions host are dynamically added and removed based on the number of incoming events.
* Premium plan, - Automatically scales based on demand using *pre-warmed workers*, which run applications with no delay after being idle, runs on more powerful instances, and connects to *virtual networks*
* App service plan (Dedicated) - Run your functions *within an App Service plan* at regular App Service plan rates. *Best for long-running scenarios* where Durable Functions can't be used.
* ASE - App Service Environment (ASE) is an App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale.
* Kubernetes - Kubernetes provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment running on top of the Kubernetes platform.

=== Scaling
Functions in consumption and premium plan are scaled similarly, it's just that premium plan uses different machines.

=== Timeouts
Timeouts are specified in host.json file and indicate the time after which a function needs to return after its trigger event.

=== Storage Account
In order to operate, azure functions require a stoage account to manage its triggers and log function execution. The same storage account can be used by triggers and functions to store app data but for storage intensive apps, it's better to use a dedicated storage.
Function code files are stored on Azure Files shares on the function's main storage account. When you delete the main storage account of the function app, the function code files are deleted and can't be recovered.

=== Function App
Function app is an execution context in which our functions run. It's a unit of deployment and management of functions. It consists of one or more functions that are scaled together and managed together. All of the functions in a single app share the same pricing plan, deployment and runtime version. In functions 2.x all functions need to be authored in the same language.

=== Triggers
Triggers define how a function is started and a function has *exactly one trigger*. Triggers carry data which is passed as a payload.
Several types of triggers:
* Webhook (HTTP Request)
* Event Hub
* Service Bus
* Timer
* Storage Queue
* Blob - ie when a file appears in a blob container.

=== Bindings
Biding is a way to connect another azure resource to a function. Bindings are optional and a function may have zero or more bindings.
Bindings can be divided into input and output bindings (or both).
Triggers and bindings let you avoid hardcoding access to other services. Your function receives data (for example, the content of a queue message) in function parameters. You send data (for example, to create a queue message) by using the return value of the function. Triggers and bindings are defined differently depending on the language. For compiled languages they're usually configured with some annotations or decorating code of some sort, for others it's _function.json_

=== Scaling
The unit of scale for Azure Functions is the function app. (which may host several functions)
In the consumption and Premium plans, functions instances are automatically added based on the amount of trigger events. Function instance is the whole unit which hosts all functions (whole function app), so single Function app will share its resources among all the functions. So in consumption plan theres a single CPU, running several functions at the same time in a single function app will mean cpu time sharing.
Whole Function apps scale independently from each other, so splitting functions across funciton apps should bring benefits.

In the Premium plan, the plan size determines the available memory and CPU for all apps in that plan on that instance.

Azure Functions uses a component called the scale controller to monitor the rate of events and determine whether to scale out or scale in. The scale controller uses heuristics for each trigger type. For example, when you're using an Azure Queue storage trigger, it scales based on the queue length and the age of the oldest queue message.
Function instances are scaled to zero when there's no traffic. Next trigger event will have an extra latency scaling fromo 0 to 1 - a cold start.

Scaling actually depends on the trigger and language mix, there are few intricacies:

* *Maximum instances*: A single function app only scales out to a maximum of 200 instances (on win consumption plan). A single instance may process more than one message or request at a time though, so there isn't a set limit on number of concurrent executions. (Single instance can process more than one trigger event this would mean)
* *New instance rate*: For HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once per second. For non-HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once every 30 seconds.

The scaling can be limited to a maximum number of instances. You can specify a lower maximum for a specific app by modifying the functionAppScaleLimit value. The functionAppScaleLimit can be set to 0 or null for unrestricted, or a valid value between 1 and the app maximum. App maximum will be 200 for Win consumption plan and 100 for Premium plan.

=== Development

The code for all the functions in a specific function app is located in a root project folder that contains a host configuration file. The _host.json_ file contains runtime-specific configurations and is in the root folder of the function app. A bin folder contains packages and other library files that the function app requires

Function consists of two important pieces - a code and a config in _function.json_ file. In compiled language the json file is created from code and its annotations. The file contains definition for function triggers, binding and some other config info.

[source, json]
----
{
    "disabled":false,
    "bindings":[
        // ... bindings here
        {
            "type": "bindingType",	// <1>
            "direction": "in",	// <2>
            "name": "myParamName",	// <3>
            // ... more depending on binding
        }
    ]
}
----
Every binding has a few required parameters
<1> the type of the binding - for example queueTrigger
<2> direction - indicates whether binding is for receiving or pushing data out of function. For triggers the direction is always in. For bindings its _in_ or _out_. Some bindings support a special direction of _inout_.
<3> the name that is used for the bound data in the function

=== Configuration
Your function project references connection information by name from its configuration provider. It doesn't directly accept the connection details, allowing them to be changed across environments. The default configuration provider uses environment variables that are set in Application Settings when running in the Azure Functions service, or from the local settings file when developing locally.
Some connections in Azure Functions are configured to use an identity instead of a secret. Support depends on the extension using the connection. In some cases, a connection string may still be required in Functions even though the service to which you're connecting supports identity-based connections.
Identity-based connections *are not supported with Durable Functions.*
Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. This is typically done by assigning a role in Azure RBAC or specifying the identity in an access policy, depending on the service to which you're connecting
